# how-to-use-wheel-colliders
Wheel Colliders are a more complex collider type in Unity. I am going to show you how to use them in this video. They are complex to setup but they do cover a lot of car physics for us automatically, and playing with the settings you can have a wide range of car type supported. You can have as many wheels on your car as you want.
